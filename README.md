# **Twitter Sentiment Analysis** 🐦🔍

This project involves analyzing the sentiment of tweets by building a machine learning model that classifies them as either positive or negative. The model is trained using a dataset of tweets and leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to clean, tokenize, and analyze the text.

---

## **Project Overview** 📝

Twitter sentiment analysis is a popular project that helps in understanding the emotions behind tweets. The project covers various steps like data exploration, cleaning, visualization, and model training. In this project, a Naive Bayes classifier is used to predict the sentiment of tweets.

## **Libraries Used** 📚

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting graphs.
- **NLTK**: For text processing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model building.
- **WordCloud**: For generating word clouds from text data.

---

## **Data Exploration** 🔍

- The dataset is loaded and explored to understand its structure.
- Visualizations are created to identify missing data and analyze tweet lengths.
- The distribution of positive and negative tweets is visualized using a bar chart.

---

## **Word Clouds** ☁️

- **WordCloud** is used to visualize the most frequent words in both positive and negative tweets.
- This helps in understanding the common words associated with each sentiment.

---

## **Data Cleaning** 🧹

- **Punctuation Removal**: Punctuation marks are removed from the tweets.
- **Stopwords Removal**: Common English stopwords are removed to focus on the important words.
- **Count Vectorization**: The cleaned text data is tokenized and converted into a matrix of token counts.

---

## **Model Training** 🎓

- A **Naive Bayes** classifier is trained using the processed text data.
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

---

## **Model Evaluation** 📊

- The trained model is evaluated using a confusion matrix and classification report.
- **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score** metrics are calculated to assess the model's performance.

---

## **Visualization** 🎨

- A heatmap of the confusion matrix is generated to visualize the model's performance.
- The length of the tweets is visualized using histograms to understand their distribution.
